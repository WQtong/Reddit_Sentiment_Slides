# Reddit_Sentiment_Slides
This is the open slides for project at NLP in Context class.

The project uses sentiment analysis based on Reddit to predict Bitcoin Price. We used SocialSent, VADER and other methods to generate sentiment score and predict price movement direction using LSTM.

My teammates require the codes are kept as private, so the repository for codes and implementation is not open. Here is the presentation slide.
